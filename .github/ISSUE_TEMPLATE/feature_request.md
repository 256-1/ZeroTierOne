If there is something you'd like to have added to ZeroTier, but not sure how to implement it, you might want to go to https://discuss.zerotier.com/c/feature-requests/ instead. Issues there can be voted on and discussed in-depth.

If you do have some code or technical examples of how you want something done in ZeroTier, you can open an issue here that we can use alongside some pull requests.

Thank you!
